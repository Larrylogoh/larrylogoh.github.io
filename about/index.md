# Me

I am a generalist.
Programming is one of my primary skills and I imagine it will stay that way for a long time.
I plan to develop other skills, but right now I'm mainly focused on programming.



# Work

I am primarily a web developer. I'm comfortable doing "full stack" work but prefer backend work.
I'm not currently employed but I am open to it.

# Tools
### Hardware
	I don't have any special hardware right now.
	My computers are two HP laptops with 5th Gen i5 CPUs.
 
### Software
	On my first laptop I run Void Linux with dwm.
	For programming and text editing I generally use emacs although I can use vim as well.
	I tend to lean towards using bash scripts and cli applications.
