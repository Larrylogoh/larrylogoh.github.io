# Profile
I was born and raised in Accra, Ghana. Most of my time as a child was spent reading and daydreaming.
After getting my first computer, I took more of an interest in technology. 
I started programming around when I was 12 as a hobby. 

Now I program a little more seriously, I don't read as much as I should and I daydream less.
I have other interests besides programming, hopefully when you read this, the website reflects that.

# Work

Right now I am primarily a web developer. I'm comfortable doing "full stack" work but prefer backend work.
I'm not currently employed but I am open to it.
