# Me

I am a generalist.
Programming is one of my primary skills and I imagine it will stay that way for a long time.
I plan to develop other skills, but right now I'm mainly focused on programming.



# Work

I am primarily a web developer. I'm comfortable doing "full stack" work but prefer backend work.
I'm not currently employed but I am open to it.

# Tools
### Hardware

I have two HP laptops which both have an Intel Core i5-5300U Processor and 8GBs of RAM.
 
### Software

On my first laptop I run OpenBSD with dwm.
For programming and text editing, I generally use emacs.
I tend to lean towards using bash scripts and cli applications in other cases.

My second laptop generally has a "just werks" operating system on it.
Sometimes it's windows, sometimes fedora or something else.
If I want a similar setup to the first laptop when I'm out and about, I have void linux on a usb drive that is usually plugged in.
