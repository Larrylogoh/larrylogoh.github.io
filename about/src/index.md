# Me

I'm not sure what I can put here without sounding pretentious.
I recommend reading my articles and the text below.
Maybe that will give you a sense of who I am.



# Work

I am primarily a web developer. 
I'm comfortable doing "full stack" work but prefer backend work.
I'm not currently employed but I am open to it.

# Tools
### Hardware

I have two HP laptops which both have an Intel Core i5-5300U Processor and 8GBs of RAM.
 
### Software

On my first laptop I run OpenBSD with dwm.
For programming and text editing, I generally use emacs.
I tend to lean towards using bash scripts and cli applications in other cases.

My second laptop generally has a "just werks" operating system on it.

Right now it's a dual boot of Void Linux and Windows.
My Void Linux system works like my OpenBSD for the most part.
I only have it because some software isn't available on OpenBSD yet.
