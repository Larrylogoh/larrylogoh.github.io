    <article><p>I think the first time I heard of <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> was in 2018. I had just started University at the time and I had been programming for about 8 years at that point. I didn’t have the confidence to take it on. Last year it came on my radar again, but I gave up after some resistance. “I have better things to do” I thought.</p>
<p>This year however I’m doing it.</p>
<p>This time I’m doing to get my Go skills to an OK level. By “OK level” I mean it should give me the skills to start a project or two and learn as I <em>go</em> along. It should also be fun as I generally enjoy puzzles.</p>
<p>I’m not planning on competing with anyone so I’ll take my time, I’ll probably finish it next month.</p>
