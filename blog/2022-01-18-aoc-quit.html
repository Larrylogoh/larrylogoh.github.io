    <p class="subtitle date">2022-01-08</p>
    <article><p>I did it for good reasons this time I promise.</p>
<p>The main reason I’m quitting is I really do not have the time. The way I see it, I don’t have the skills to solve the puzzles as quickly as I would like. It takes me way too long to solve the problems and I assume the complexity will continue to increase at least to a certain point.</p>
<p>I have work(National Service) now, which takes around 12 hours of my time. I also have side projects(coming soon) that will take up most of the extra time. So I’ll give up on last year’s advent of code. By the time this year ends, I should be able to handle the next one.</p></article>
