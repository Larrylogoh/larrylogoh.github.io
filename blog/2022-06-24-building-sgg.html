    <h1 class="title">Building a static site generator</h1>
    <p class="subtitle date">2022-06-24</p>
    <article><p>What I was using is <a
href="https://github.com/lawrencelogoh/lawrencelogoh.github.io/blob/921d8d1012f73c6298b7d5412404b0f7b2a33ed/build">a
badly written bash script that depends on pup and pandoc</a>. I don’t
mind the pandoc dependency too much as I have it on all my systems
anyway. But the script is messy and I’d rather have something
cleaner.</p>
<p>“Why not just use x?”</p>
<p>Most of the static site generators I’ve seen like Hugo and Jekyll
seem too complicated for me. I’m not saying I can’t use them, I just
felt some friction and thought it would be cool to build my own.</p>
<p>My requirements for the current script were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must have as few dependencies as possible.</li>
<li>Must work on UNIX/UNIX-like systems</li>
<li>Must generate an RSS file with all blog posts</li>
<li>Must arrange blog posts by date</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn’t put too much thought into how the old script worked. I
started by writing a function that compiles the markdown files of my
blog posts. Everything else came after that. Whenever I hit a roadblock,
I looked for a program that could help me. In the end, I had a hacky
script that worked but I wasn’t proud of it. I also started to run into
problems when I wanted to add new functionality or change something.</p>
<p><a
href="https://github.com/lawrencelogoh/lawrencelogoh.github.io/blob/9c27fe701fb522f936147f5ad5fbd01a02f7ad13/build">The
current script</a> is not as bad. The way that it works is, it assumes
every directory(including the root directory) has an <code>src</code>
subdirectory. It compiles every markdown file in the <code>src</code>
subdirectories to HTML files that live in the directory itself. To get
away with not creating an <code>index.html</code> I create an
<code>index.md</code> instead and that gets compiled like every other
markdown file.</p>
<p>That’s the core of how it works. If you want the details, read the
script.</p>
<p>I’m happy with how it works right now but there’s a minor annoyance I
have with it. The blog posts are arranged according to their dates by
putting the date in the file name.</p>
<p><em>Yuck</em>.</p>
<p>I tried using an associative array to do it at first, but I found it
difficult to sort the dates with the sort program. I’ll figure it out
eventually</p>
<p>If you have any suggestions email me or send a pull request
