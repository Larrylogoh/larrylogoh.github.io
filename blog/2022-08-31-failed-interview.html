    <p class="subtitle date">2022-08-31</p>
    <article><p><em>Dear Lawrence,</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you for attending your interview with us.</em></p>
<p><em>Unfortunately we have chosen to not move your application
forward…</em></p>
<p>This is part of an email I got shortly after doing a live coding
interview. The interviewer was really nice and it felt like they
genuinely wanted to see me do well. But I didn’t. And no, this wasn’t a
super hard coding question. It was an easier version of <a

2021</a> which I had done before. But for whatever reason, I wasn’t able
to produce a solution to the problem before my time was up. I had many
thoughts after getting the email. &gt; “I should’ve done more leetcode”
&gt; “If only I didn’t use python” &gt; “I would’ve seen the solution if
I didn’t panic”</p>
<p>Logically, I know it doesn’t matter too much. There will be many more
interviews to come. But I still felt like shit.</p>
<p>Looking on the bright side. It wasn’t as scary as I thought it would
be. I think I’ll try a few more and see how it goes.</p></article>
