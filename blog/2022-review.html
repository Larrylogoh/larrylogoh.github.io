    <p class="subtitle date">2022-12-29</p>
    <article><p>Overall, this was a good year. Unfortunately, I wasn’t
as productive as I had hoped to be. But, I learned a lot about myself
and I made progress. I started learning Go and C, started some new
projects, and even lost some weight. I also made some new friends along
the way.</p>
<p>While I’m happy with how the year went in general, I can’t help but
feel like I could have done more. One of the big things I tried to learn
was to not take things too seriously. It would feel like the world was
ending if I forgot about some homework, for example. I feel I may have
taken a bit too far, but I think I’m ready to take a more balanced
approach. I have a good feeling about next year.</p></article>
