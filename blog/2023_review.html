    <article><p>The plan this year was to play to my strengths and work on my weaknesses. I ended up doing both very poorly.</p>
<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
<p>My Life Management System(LMS) is at the point where I can see myself using it for the rest of my life. It’s very simple and doesn’t really depend on any tools even though I only use it with emacs. There are a few issues like, using it on mobile but I think I can find an app that works reasonably well or make one.</p>
<p>My productivity itself has been boosted. Not only because of the system but because I pushed myself and realised what I was capable of.</p>
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
<p>I made a lot of progress here. I called people I care about a few times. Made time to just hang out where just being around friends was the goal. I checked on people a few times as well.</p>
<p>In terms of romantic relationships, I tried. I generally don’t try but I tried this time. I was unsuccessful but I learned a lot not just about what I like but about the kind of person I am.</p>
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<p>So I programmed a lot this year. More than I did last year. But I didn’t do exactly what I planned to do. I planned to get better at Python and Go and try out Rust and Zig. I got a job where I mainly work with JavaScript so that became my main focus. I did learn Python and Go but not as much as I had planned to. I didn’t even touch Rust and Zig. I did do some mobile development but no OS development.</p>
<p>I’m not happy with how this went, but I’ll try again next year.</p>
<h2 id="money">Money</h2>
<p>I didn’t get to my goal of $2000/month. I have however moved from making $0 to a respectable amount. I’ve also had to think about money a lot<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. I’ve decided that I want a lot of it now and I’m going to try everything I can to get it without compromising my morals or ethics.</p>
<h2 id="other-skills">Other skills</h2>
<p>I’m not sure if my writing has improved or not. What I do know is that I’m not yet good enough so I’m going to keep trying.</p>
<p>I haven’t practised drawing enough but I am practising.</p>
<p>I didn’t buy an electric guitar but I have started learning how to use a DAW to make music. Music is the hardest thing I’ve had to learn so far but I will keep trying.</p>
<hr />
<p>Overall, this was a good year. I’m not happy with how some things went, but I’ll learn from it and try to make next year better.</p>
