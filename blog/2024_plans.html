    <h1 class="title">Plans for 2023</h1>
        <p class="subtitle date">2024-01-01</p>
        
    <article><p>The plan this year is to get good. I’m okay at a few things, but I need to get really good. I will write a detailed list of actions I will need to do to make this year a success but I’m not sure if I’ll release it publicly or not. We’ll see.</p>
<h2 id="health">Health</h2>
<p>This is going to be one of my main priorities this year. The goal here is to lose weight and get in shape.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A healthy mind resides in a healthy body</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My mental health isn’t a big priority this year. I have a high baseline of happiness so we can leave that for another time. This doesn’t mean I will be neglecting it but it won’t be a high priority.</p>
<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
<p>My system is at a place that I’m really happy with. The focus for this would be to build habits that will help me be more productive.</p>
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
<p>A lot of progress was made last year but there is still more to be made. The goal is to be more proactive and not just leave things to chance. Yes, this applies to romantic relationships as well.</p>
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<p>I’ve done a lot of learning when it comes to programming but very little doing. I’m still going to be learning but I’ll be writing a lot of <del>bad</del> software so that I can get better.</p>
<h2 id="money">Money</h2>
<p>The goal is the same as last year $2000/month.</p>
<h2 id="other-skills">Other skills</h2>
<p>This year, the focus is on design. Mainly graphic design and UI/UX design. I will focus on writing and making music with a DAW as well.</p>
<p>Happy New Year.</p></article>
