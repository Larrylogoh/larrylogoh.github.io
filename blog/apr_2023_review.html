    <article><p>Better late than never…right?</p>
<p>This month was rough. I thought it’d be a piece of cake to handle
school, work and personal projects. It wasn’t.</p>
<h2 id="money">Money</h2>
<p>It’s nice having a regular stream of income. It’s liberating in a
way. Things I want to try out or buy don’t seem out of reach. I’ve been
winging it when it comes to management though, so I’ll be taking it more
seriously going forward.</p>
<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
<p>I had some health issues that lasted for about a week. This made it
hard to get back into a rhythm but I figured it out eventually. I think
I was sufficiently productive, but this is only true when it comes to
work and school. My personal projects didn’t get any love. I think I’ve
found my feet at work now so it shouldn’t be a problem going forward. My
school workload is going to reduce next semester too so that should
help.</p>
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<p>I haven’t made much progress on this outside of work. So my
JavaScript skills have gone up, but that’s a consequence of working with
it, not intentionally trying to improve. I intend to change that next
month. I want to be more intentional about it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Decent month.</p>
<p>Not the best but I can only look forward and try harder. Hopefully
next month will be better.</p></article>
