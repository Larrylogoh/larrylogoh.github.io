    <article><p>This month was stressful. Not stressful in the sense that I pushed myself. Stressful in the sense that there were interpersonal issues that I had to deal with. It has made me question how I navigate relationships with other people.</p>
<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
<p>I wasn’t as productive as I was last month.</p>
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
<p>I barely communicated with the people I care about.</p>
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<p>I also didn’t program as much as last month. There was a lot of planning but very little doing.</p>
<h2 id="money">Money</h2>
<p>Money was tight. Luckily, I don’t require that much money to survive now so I’m good. Next month will be better.</p>
<h2 id="other-skills">Other skills</h2>
<p>I tried to learn whenever it came up in my calendar. I missed some days but I’ll keep trying.</p>
<hr />
<p>I managed to push through. I think next month will be better but we’ll see.</p></article>
