    <h1 class="title">February 2023 Review</h1>
    <p class="subtitle date">2023-02-28</p>
    <article><p>I’ve made more progress than I did last month. Some
areas are essentially “done” but what’s left is to build habits around
them. I won’t talk about some areas but that’s because there’s either no
progress or no notable progress.</p>
<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
<p>I’m happy with the current system I have. It does exactly what I want
it to. I’m not fully used to all parts of it but that’ll come with time.
One new thing I want to try is <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghVdzAeX0bg">batching</a>. This is
because when I work on things for extended periods of time(4+ hours) I
feel more productive. The <a
href="https://www.apa.org/topics/research/multitasking">task switching
costs</a> for my normal days seem to be a lot of wasted time.</p>
<p>In other news, my <a
href="https://github.com/lawrencelogoh/kms">kms</a> is out. It’s empty
right now, but I will be adding to it over time.</p>
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
<p>The framework I use for this is satisfactory. It still feels
uncomfortable and I don’t always follow through. My intuition is that
this is because it’s a foreign thing for me, so I’ll try to power
through and hope it gets easier with time. If it doesn’t I’ll have to
make some modifications to the system.</p>
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<p>Programming is hard. I’ve realized that I know quite a few
programming languages but I don’t know them well enough to use them in a
real project. Case in point my project Homebase. I decided to use Go for
this project but there was too much resistance when I was building it.
It felt like I was fighting against the language. What I’ve decided to
do is to build a <a
href="https://github.com/homebaseorg/homebase-prototype">prototype</a>
in Python first and then build the real project in Go. I am still doing
my boosts of course, when I’m done doing them I will release them on
Github.</p>
<h2 id="school">School</h2>
<p>The current system is good enough. I have taken a bit of a different
approach of how I use it though. Normally, what I would do is I would
try and fit exactly what the lecturer says or their slides into the
flashcards. It worked but there was too much fluff so now what I do is,
I “prune” my notes before making flashcards.</p>
<h2 id="something-interesting-im-thinking-about">Something Interesting
I’m Thinking About</h2>
<p>I forget how I came across the concept of an <a
href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2008/readings/engler95exokernel.pdf">exokernel</a>
but it’s been stuck in my head ever since. In simple terms, an exokernel
is a minimalist operating system architecture that gives applications
direct access to hardware resources for optimized performance and
flexibility. From that, I’m sure a plethora of reasons come to mind
about why this would be a bad idea. I just think it would be a fun thing
to build.</p>
<p>Overall, this month was better than last month.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t mind if every month was like this</p></article>
