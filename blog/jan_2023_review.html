    <h1 class="title">Finding my Feet (January 2023 Review)</h1>
    <p class="subtitle date">2023-02-01</p>
    <article><p>I haven’t made much headway with <a
href="https://lawrencelogoh.com/blog/2023_plans.html">my goals for this
year</a>. Most of the month was spent figuring out how to structure
things. I’ve figured out some things about myself and some external
factors have also changed. My school. for example, decided to change the
schedule of how school is going to be attended so I had to adapt.</p>
<h2 id="money">Money</h2>
<p>Outside of <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/larrylogoh">fiverr</a> I’m
talking to some people but nothing concrete yet so fingers crossed.</p>
<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
<p>I significantly modified and streamlined my Life Management
System(LMS). This has resulted in me doing more every week. There are
still things I have to figure out about myself when it comes to working
on personal projects. I have a pattern where I work in “bursts” and then
I don’t do anything for a while. I’m going to try and see if I can work
on things more consistently, but if I can’t I’ll have to find a way to
use this to my advantage. There are other systems that I have added that
are not public yet because they’re still being fleshed out. A Knowledge
Management System(KMS) and a Zettelkasten that I will use to post things
that don’t really warrant a blog post.</p>
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
<p>I managed to call people I normally would never call and I’ve added
some reminders to call people so I don’t forget. I plan to continue this
next month and do more. I’ve also scheduled group calls with friends, so
I have people to talk to outside of family and work friends.</p>
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<p>I’ve started projects I call “boosts”. I pilfered the idea from <a
href="https://github.com/rwxrob">rwxrob</a>. The general idea is they’re
supposed to get me or someone like me to a point where they know and
have used certain techniques. So in the case of python_boost, I’ve
learned how to use decorators properly and I have a project where I’m
going to use it so the general idea sticks in my head. They will be made
available on <a href="https://github.com/lawrencelogoh">my github</a> so
keep an eye out.</p>
<h2 id="other-skills">Other Skills</h2>
<p>I suspect I’ve made zero progress here. When it comes to creative
writing, I would classify it as a “wicked domain”, as described by David
Epstein in Range. I’m not sure if becoming good, is a matter of
deliberate practice alone but I’m sure it helps. I’ll read some books
about writing and see what comes of it. I’ll also analyze writing that I
like and see what I can take from them. In the case of the other
creative outlet, I’ve made no progress there as well. I’m tempted to
start making electronic music instead of waiting to get a guitar. If I
don’t get an electric guitar by June I’ll start that instead.</p>
<h2 id="school">School</h2>
<p>I didn’t add this to my goals for this year because it wasn’t but I
want to try harder at school. Yes, I’ve made a system for this too. I
did have one already but it wasn’t clearly defined. I basically took
notes and made flashcards that I studied a day to exams. I managed to
get A+s in subjects I liked but did abysmally even in difficult subjects
I liked.</p>
<p>All in all, it’s been a good month but I’ll try to do better next
month.</p></article>
