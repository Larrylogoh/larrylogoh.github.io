    <h1 class="title">July 2023 Review</h1>
        <p class="subtitle date">2023-08-01</p>
        
    <article><p>This is my worst month so far. The general theme has
been “reactionary”.</p>
<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
<p>My productivity level is satisfactory. I’m not as disciplined as I
want to be but I’m getting there.</p>
<p>My Life Management System(LMS) is at a place I’m happy with right
now. There might be slight tweaks in the future but I consider the
project done. Expect an article on that soon :).</p>
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
<p>This time I have negative feelings about this area. I didn’t make
time for the people I care about. And I haven’t been straightforward
with people.</p>
<p>A regression, to be sure, but all I can do is try to be better.</p>
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<p>Progress has been made here. I have dedicated time to learning and
I’m sticking to it as best as I can. The results will speak for
themselves :).</p>
<h2 id="money">Money</h2>
<p>There has been no progress on making extra money. On the bright side,
I’ve made progress on managing the money I do have. Speaking of money,
most people seem really weird about it. Maybe “pocket watching” is the
best way to describe it. It’s made me consider not talking about it
publicly anymore.</p>
<p>On the other hand, maybe it’s a good way to filter out certain people
from my life.</p>
<h2 id="other-skills">Other skills</h2>
<p>I’ve downloaded Ardour and I’m playing around with it. Don’t expect
an EDM album anytime soon though.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how to gauge if my writing is improving or not. Maybe
you can tell?</p>
<hr />
<p>Overall, not a bad month, but not a great one either. I’ll try to do
better next month.</p></article>
