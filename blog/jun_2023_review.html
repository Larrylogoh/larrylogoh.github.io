    <article><p>Halfway there.</p>
<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
<p>Considering where I was in January, I have positive feelings about this. I still use org files but things are a little different. I’m more confident with the system, and I’m doing more things. I haven’t necessarily been doing the right things, but again, progress has been made. There’s room for improvement.</p>
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
<p>This is another one where I have positive feelings. I’ve called people I cared about and I made time for activities with them. I wasn’t as consistent as I wanted to be but again, progress.</p>
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<p>This is where things start to go downhill. I have improved, but not as much as I wanted to. On top of that, most of my improvement weren’t from deliberate learning, which I don’t like. I also have nothing to show for it outside of work. Radical change will need to be made for me to be happy with this.</p>
<h2 id="money">Money</h2>
<p>This is another one I’m happy about. I’m not making my goal of $2000/month. I’m not even making my goal of $1000 month. I still want to make $2000/month. My current job is flexible enough that it’s possible if I do more online gigs. Even if I don’t get to $2000/month, the fact that I’ve made progress makes me happy. It’s better than $0/month.</p>
<h2 id="other-skills">Other skills</h2>
<p>I’ve made zero progress in this area. I’m not sure how I feel about that. I think I can still make time for these things. I don’t think my writing has improved at all. There’s no excuse. I haven’t tried to actively improve. I haven’t bought a guitar yet, so I’m considering diving into EDM production and seeing how I like it.</p>
<hr />
<p>I’m happy with how the year has gone overall but improvements can be made.</p></article>
