    <h1 class="title">March 2023 Review</h1>
    <p class="subtitle date">2023-03-31</p>
    <article><p>This was a great month. I haven’t built as many great
habits as I wanted to but I’m trying and these things take time.</p>
<h2 id="money">Money</h2>
<p>I landed a job with a company called <a
href="https://torus.blue">Blue Torus</a>. The pay is good, the hours are
amazing and I get to work with cool people. I’m still a ways from my
goal of $2000 a month but this is stable income, which is a big
improvement from only doing freelancing gigs. I am still freelancing
though, the hours for the job are flexible enough that I can do
that.</p>
<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
<p>One thing I’ve decided to add to my productivity system is my
finances. I’ve decided to take my finances a bit more seriously so I can
be more responsible with my money. The tool is a bit of a problem right
now though. I want to use something like Ledger in combination with
ledger-mode because it deals with plaintext files, but I have to learn
it a little bit before it can become useful. I was torn between that and
using something like GNUCash so I’m trying it out first. If it doesn’t
work I’ll use GNUCash or maybe even just org tables.</p>
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I haven’t made too much progress on this. I haven’t
been able to consistently work on the projects that I’ve created to up
my skills. I did do some work on the <a
href="https://github.com/homebaseorg/homebase-prototype">Homebase
prototype</a> and I’ve learned more about React and NextJS which my new
job requires. It’s not all bad but this will be one of my main focal
points moving forward.</p>
<h2 id="the-dark-lining-in-the-silver-cloud">The dark lining in the
silver cloud</h2>
<p>Maybe a week after I started my new job, I was pickpocketed. I didn’t
lose any money but I did lose my phone. I got a replacement the next
day, it’s a worse phone but it’ll do for now.</p>
<hr />
<p>Great month overall.</p>
<p>Unlike last month I would mind if every month went like this. Can’t
be losing my phone every month.</p></article>
