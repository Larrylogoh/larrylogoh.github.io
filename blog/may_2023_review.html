        <p class="subtitle date">2023-06-20</p>
        
    <article><p>This was another rough month. To a lesser extent than last month, but still…</p>
<p>My main focus was work and writing exams this month. It was less rough because the exams are spaced out differently and they don’t take as much time as a class.</p>
<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
<p>I’ve become more productive but I’ve noticed that most of the things I’m doing aren’t directly related to my goals. Things are getting done but not the most important things. I didn’t think I’d have this problem so it’s something to think about.</p>
<p>I don’t have anything else to say about other areas of my life. Things have been the same since last month. I don’t think that’s a good thing.</p>
<hr />
<p>Yes, you didn’t read the date wrong. I almost didn’t want to write this but I had to. I’ll write the next one on time and we’ll continue like nothing happened.</p></article>
