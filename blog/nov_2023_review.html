    <h1 class="title">November 2023 Review</h1>
        <p class="subtitle date">2023-11-30</p>
        
    <article><p>This month was for resting. I didnâ€™t push myself as hard
as I could on most days. I felt a little guilty because of this, but I
think itâ€™s good. It was a well earned rest after going full throttle for
quite a while.</p>
<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
<p>I wasnâ€™t as productive as I was last month but because my baseline
productivity has increased, Iâ€™m not too worried about this.</p>
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
<p>I spent time with the people I cared about when I could, so Iâ€™m good
on this front.</p>
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<p>Iâ€™ve had time to think about this quite a bit and to decide my
direction going forward. I know it sounds confusing but youâ€™ll
understand after you read the next article.</p>
<p>In terms of doing programming itself, I didnâ€™t program as much as
last month.</p>
<h2 id="money">Money</h2>
<p>Money was a little tight this month, but I was able to stay afloat.
Iâ€™ll also be talking about it in the next article.</p>
<p>Oh I did create a whole system to manage my finances though. I call
it the Personal Finance System(PFS). I wonâ€™t go into it right now
because I still consider it a work in progress but itâ€™s basically a
system to manage money based on sound advice but also catering to my
specific idiosyncrasies.</p>
<h2 id="other-skills">Other skills</h2>
<p>I didnâ€™t put as much effort into this like everything else, but Iâ€™ve
found a way to schedule them in my calendar as they are becoming a bit
much to manage. Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll pick up others along the way but they will
be put on the back burner until I drop any of the current ones.</p>
<hr />
<p>Decent month overall. I think Iâ€™m ready to start going hard again but
Iâ€™ll try not to get too close to the sun ðŸ™‚.</p></article>
