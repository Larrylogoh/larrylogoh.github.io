    <article><p>It was tough balancing, school, work and freelance gigs but I managed to do it. Now school is off the plate so we can redirect energy elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
<p>This is the most productive I’ve ever been. However, it was mostly fueled by coffee, red bull and dread. So in other words, not sustainable. A strange thing that has happened as a result of this is that I feel like I’ve “unlocked” something. I’ll have to think about it a bit more but my it feels like my baseline productivity has improved as a result.</p>
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
<p>I was busy but not busy enough to not make time. I could’ve done better. I’ll try to do better next month.</p>
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<p>I’ve done a lot of programming this month. I’m not sure if that translates to me being better but it’s something.</p>
<h2 id="money">Money</h2>
<p>I made some extra money this month. It came with added stress but it was worth it. Now that I’m done with school I can put in more effort into getting money.</p>
<h2 id="other-skills">Other skills</h2>
<p>I’m still learning how to make music with Ardour. It might be the hardest thing I’ve had to learn. It just feels foreign to me and there’s so much to take in.</p>
<p>I’m also learning how to draw and UI/UX design. I’m learning drawing for fun but I’m learning UI/UX design to be able to build web apps from end to end instead of just being able to code a design.</p>
<hr />
<p>Overall, good month. I’m still reeling from the roller coaster that was last month but I think I’ll be 100% soon and things will be back to normal.</p></article>
