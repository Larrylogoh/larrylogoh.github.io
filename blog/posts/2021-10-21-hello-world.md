Hello, World!

I took too long to build this site but I'm finally "done"[^1].
I'm sure writing articles will be harder than building this but they won't be as slow.

I have a lot of interests and this blog will reflect that.
The constant one will be technology and there will be other things related and unrelated.

If you ever want to complain or tell me why I'm wrong on anything, email me at [lawrence.logoh@gmail.com](mailto:lawrence.logoh@gmail.com)

[^1]: Obviously there will be improvements, but it works.
