I think the first time I heard of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) was in 2018.
I had just started University at the time and I had been programming for about 8 years at that point.
I didn't have the confidence to take it on.
Last year it came on my radar again, but I gave up after some resistance. "I have better things to do" I thought.

This year however I'm doing it.

This time I'm doing to get my Go skills to an OK level.
By "OK level" I mean it should give me the skills to start a project or two and learn as I _go_ along.
It should also be fun as I generally enjoy puzzles.

I'm not planning on competing with anyone so I'll take my time, I'll probably finish it next month.
