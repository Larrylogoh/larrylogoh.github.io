I did it for good reasons this time I promise.

The main reason I'm quitting is I really do not have the time.
The way I see it, I don't have the skills to solve the puzzles as quickly as I would like.
It takes me way too long to solve the problems and I assume the complexity will continue to increase at least to a certain point.

I have work(National Service) now, which takes around 12 hours of my time.
I also have side projects(coming soon) that will take up most of the extra time.
So I'll give up on last year's advent of code.
By the time this year ends, I should be able to handle the next one.
