# Why not just use "x"?

Most of the static site generators I've seen like Hugo and Jekyll seem too complicated for me.

I'm not saying I can't use them, I just felt some friction and thought it would be cool to build my own.

# Requirements 
- Must have as little dependencies as possible.
- Must work on UNIX/UNIX-like systems
- Must generate and RSS file with all blog posts
