_Dear Lawrence,_

_Thank you for attending your interview with us._

_Unfortunately we have chosen to not move your application forward..._

This is part of an email I got shortly after doing a live coding interview.
The interviewer was really nice and it felt like they genuinely wanted to see me do well.
But I didn't.
And no, this wasn't a super hard coding question.
It was an easier version of [day 2 of advent of code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2) which I had done before.
But for whatever reason, I wasn't able to produce a solution to the problem before my time was up.
I had many thoughts after getting the email.
> "I should've done more leetcode"
> "If only I didn't use python"
> "I would've seen the solution if I didn't panic"

Logically, I know it doesn't matter too much.
There will be many more interviews to come.
But I still felt like shit.

Looking on the bright side.
It wasn't as scary as I thought it would be.
I think I'll try a few more and see how it goes.
