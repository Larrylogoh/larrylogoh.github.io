Overall, this was a good year.
Unfortunately, I wasn't as productive as I had hoped to be.
But, I learned a lot about myself and I made progress.

I started learning Go and C, started some new projects, and even lost some weight.
I also made some new friends along the way.

While I'm happy with how the year went in general, I can't help but feel like I could have done more.

One of the big things I tried to learn was to not take things too seriously.
It would feel like the world was ending if I forgot about some homework, for example.
I feel like I took it a bit too far, but I think I'm ready to try a more *balanced* approach.

I have a good feeling about next year.
