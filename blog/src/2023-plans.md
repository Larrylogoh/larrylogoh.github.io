The basic idea behind this year is to play to my strengths and work on my weaknesses. Min-maxing essentially. 
A lot of these things are not a checklist item that I can just list and tick off.
They require step-by-step plans which I will make and follow.

## Productivity
I already have a system that I use to manage my life. It's just a folder of org files that I like to call my LMS(Life Management System).
I plan to rethink and clearly define this system and some of the other systems that I use in conjunction with it.
I think doing that will boost my productivity.

## Programming

I know some programming languages but I don't think I know any of them well enough.
So the plan is to become good at two of them at least. 
Python and Go seem like the obvious choices so I'll go with them for now.
While I do that, I also plan to at least check out Rust and Zig and see how I like them.
Beyond that, I will be trying out other domains like mobile development and OS development(for fun).

## Money
I've lived a very comfortable life.Because of that, I haven't had to really think about money until now.
I want to do a lot of cool stuff but money seems to be the thing that I lack to do them.
So this year, I'm going to focus on making money.
My humble goal for now is at least a steady income of $2000.
I know I can make more than that, but I live in Ghana, and most employers don't pay that much.
I'm going to try to make this by freelancing and building projects. I'll add a job if necessary. 


There are other goals I have but I'm not sure if it's appropriate to share them publicly.
