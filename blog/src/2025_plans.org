He is a genius, a philosopher, an abstract thinker. He has a brain of
the first order. He sits motionless, like a spider in the center of its
web, but that web has a thousand radiations, and he knows well every
quiver of each of them. He does little himself. He only plans.

/-- Arthur Conan Doyle, The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes/

The general idea this year is to make and do things.
I plan a lot but I end up finishing very little. 
As such, I've decided to reduce the amount of things I do so that I can
finish more things.
This time, I will share the actions for each section.

* Health
My weight is the main problem here, so the main thing I will be focusing
on this year is my diet and eating habits. Exercise will be a secondary
focus and I'm sure it'll also help a bit. The main reason I'm including
exercise is that it makes me feel good.

** Actions
*** DONE Create exercise habit in Life Management System(LMS)
*** DONE Create spreadsheet to track weight
*** DONE Start "weight loss" project
* Productivity
I've always known that willpower is finite but I acted as if mine wasn't.
Limiting the things I do within a day has been helpful so I'm going to
keep doing that.
The main thing I will be focusing on here is finishing personal
projects. 
Last year I started more than twenty personal projects but I finished
maybe two. 
I'm going to try to not start any more personal projects and finish some
of the current projects instead.

** Actions
*** DOING Finish three personal projects
*** TODO Build three digital products
* Programming
I spent a lot of time programming last year.
Most of it was not focused practice or learning though, I was just
trying to get things to work.
I learned new programming languages but I'm still not good at any of
them.
I started learning OCaml for advent of code so I'll still keep learning
that but I won't be learning any new programming languages this year.

** Actions
*** DONE Create leetcode habit in LMS
*** DOING Finish programming boost
The programming boost is a project I created to "get good" at the
programming languages I already know and DSA
*** TODO Finish [[https://threejs-journey.com/][ThreeJS Journey]] course
*** TODO Read [[https://interpreterbook.com/][Writing An Interpreter In Go]]

* Relationships
I was a bit more proactive in my relationships last year.
This was a big improvement from previous years.
This year I want to spend more time with people I care about.
There are a lot of cool people I know that I want to be closer to but I
didn't make time for them.
On the romantic side, I wasn't as proactive as I could've been so I'm
going to do that this year.

** Actions
*** DOING Go out with friends at least ten times [0/10]
*** TODO Ask at most ten girls out on a date
The goal is to get a girlfriend but I do not want to go on a date with
more than ten people.

* Money
Like I said in [[https://lawrencelogoh.com/blog/2024-review.html][my 2024 review]], people are weird about money so I'm not
going to talk about concrete amounts. The overall goal is to double my
current income.

** Actions
*** DONE Create client acquisition habit in LMS
*** DOING Start a business
I've mostly been using platforms like Fiverr and Upwork but I think it's
time to start a business proper.
*** TODO Get a salary increase
* Other skills
Last year the goal was to focus on Graphic Design and UI/UX Design.
I ended up doing too many things instead.
This year I'll be focusing on UI/UX Design and playing guitar.

** Actions
*** DONE Create UI/UX Design learning habit in LMS
*** DONE Create classical guitar learning habit in LMS
*** DOING Finish three design projects
*** TODO Learn how to play three pieces

* Conclusion
This list seems more doable than what I had last year. I also made the
mistake of adding some goals to my plans but because they weren't very
actionable I didn't /do/ anything.


There are other things I want to do but they don't fit properly into any
of the categories and some are a bit sensitive so I'll keep those to
myself.
If I end up doing them, I will post about it on [[https://x.com/lawrencelogoh][my Twitter]] and/or
[[https://instagram.com/larrylogoh][Instagram]].


Happy New Year.
