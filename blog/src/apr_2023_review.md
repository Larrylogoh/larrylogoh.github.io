Better late than never...right?

This month was rough. I thought it'd be a piece of cake to handle school, work and personal projects. 
It wasn't.

## Money
It's nice having a regular stream of income. It's liberating in a way. Things I want to try out or buy don't seem out of reach. I've been winging it when it comes to management though, so I'll be taking it more seriously going forward. 

## Productivity
I had some health issues that lasted for about a week. This made it hard to get back into a rhythm but I figured it out eventually.
I think I was sufficiently productive, but this is only true when it comes to work and school.
My personal projects didn't get any love. I think I've found my feet at work now so it shouldn't be a problem going forward. My school workload is going to reduce next semester too so that should help.

## Programming
I haven't made much progress on this outside of work. So my JavaScript skills have gone up, but that's a consequence of working with it not intentionally trying to improve. I intend to change that next month. I want to be more intentional about it.

Decent month.

Not the best but I can only look forward and try harder.
Hopefully next month will be better.
