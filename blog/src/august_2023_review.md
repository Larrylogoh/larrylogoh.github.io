This was a good month.
It has been incredibly stressful but I was able to handle it.

## Productivity
Satisfactory.
Things are getting done.

I've also been working on building some good habits.
So far it's going well.

## Relationships
Progress has been made here.
I've hashed out some issues I neglected.
It feels freeing. 

It's not perfect but the needle was moved.

## Programming
Progress was made but not as much as I would've liked. 

I haven't been able to dedicate larger timeblocks due to other
priorities[^1].

[^1]: The biggest one being my final year project for university
    
## Money
No progress here but this is intentional.
Trying to take on more work when I can't will only hurt me.

It can wait.

## Other skills
I've put a hold on this until I can dedicate time to them.

When I engage in forms of escapism like watching YouTube, I try make it
related to writing, music or other skills I'm interested in.

Overall, I feel good about this month.
I can only hope it'll increase my stress tolerance. 

Good job, Me.
