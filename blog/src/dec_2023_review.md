This month was stressful. Not stressful in the sense that I pushed
myself. Stressful in the sense that there were interpersonal issues that
I had to deal with. It has made me question how I navigate relationships
with other people.

## Productivity
I wasn't as productive as I was last month. 

## Relationships
I barely communicated with the people I care about. 

## Programming
I also didn't program as much as last month.
There was a lot of planning but very little doing. 

## Money
Money was tight. Luckily, I don't require that much money to survive now
so I'm good. Next month will be better.

## Other skills
I tried to learn whenever it came up in my calendar. I missed some days
but I'll keep trying.

I managed to push through. I think next month will be better but we'll see.
