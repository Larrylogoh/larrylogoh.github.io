I've made more progress than I did last month.
Some areas are essentially "done" but what's left is to build habits around them. 
I won't talk about some areas but that's because there's either no progress or no notable progress.

## Productivity
I'm happy with the current system I have. It does exactly what I want it to.
I'm not fully used to all parts of it but that'll come with time. 
One new thing I want to try is [batching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghVdzAeX0bg). 
This is because when I work on things for extended periods of time(4+ hours) I feel more productive.
The [task switching costs](https://www.apa.org/topics/research/multitasking) for my normal days seem to be a lot of wasted time.

In other news, my [kms](https://github.com/lawrencelogoh/kms) is out. It's empty right now, but I will be adding to it over time.


## Relationships
The framework I use for this is satisfactory. It still feels uncomfortable and I don't always follow through. My intuition is that this is because it's a foreign thing for me, so I'll try to power through and hope it gets easier with time. If it doesn't I'll have to make some modifications to the system.

## Programming
Programming is hard. I've realized that I know quite a few programming languages but I don't know them well enough to use them in a real project. Case in point my project Homebase. I decided to use Go for this project but there was too much resistance when I was building it. It felt like I was fighting against the language. What I've decided to do is to build a prototype in Python first and then build the real project in Go. I am still doing my boosts of course, when I'm done doing them I will release them on Github.

## School
The current system is good enough. I have taken a bit of a different approach of how I use it though. Normally, what I would do is I would try and fit exactly what the lecturer says or their slides into the flashcards. It worked but there was too much fluff so now what I do is, I "prune" my notes before making flashcards.

## Something Interesting I'm Thinking About
I forget how I came across the concept of an [exokernel](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2008/readings/engler95exokernel.pdf) but it's been stuck in my head ever since. In simple terms, an exokernel is a minimalist operating system architecture that gives applications direct access to hardware resources for optimized performance and flexibility. From that, I'm sure a plethora of reasons come to mind about why this would be a bad idea. I just think it would be a fun thing to build.

Overall, this month was better than last month.
It can always be better but it was good.

I wouldn't mind if every month was like this
