Overall, this was an amazing month.
I graduated from University, I bought a classical guitar and started
learning how to play and I even lost some weight.
This should be a good month on paper but I'm not happy about it.
I think I could've done better.

There's also another issue I've been thinking about with these posts.
It feels like it's a bit too personal.
I'm not sure how helpful any of this is to anyone or if anyone is
reading them.
So I've decided to publishing them and just keep them private for now.
I was trying to "document not create" and it was nice for a while but I
think I'm ready to create now.

The website will get redesigned after a while and I will remove all
posts like this one except the yearly plans and reviews.

## Health
I was able to workout for about 20 days out of 29.
I'm not happy about the number but it's a step in the right direction.
I haven't had as much soda as I did last month and I have lost about 2KG
of weight.
Again, not happy, but it's something.

## Productivity
 I've been able to do some habits but consistently but others, not so
 much.
 My morning and evening routines have been mostly consistent but the
 others have not been.
I'll keep trying but if nothing changes I will have to modify my
 approach.
 
## Programming
 I was able to program on most days and I'm still learning about data
 structures and algorithms and ThreeJS.
 For data structures and algorithms I'm using the CRLS algorithms book
 and for ThreeJS I'm using the ThreeJS docs.
 My team lead at work also takes some time to teach me stuff about
 ThreeJS.
 
## Other skills
 I've learned a bit about design and I've started learning how to play
 the guitar.
 For design, it's mostly typography, and even the little I've learned
 makes me feel like redesigning the website.
 For guitar, I've created a playlist of cherry picked lessons that I
 follow and I also have another playlist of songs that I try to play.
