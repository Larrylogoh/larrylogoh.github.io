I haven't made much headway with [my goals for this year](https://lawrencelogoh.com/blog/2023_plans.html).
Most of the month was spent figuring out how to structure things.
I've figured out some things about myself and some external factors have also changed.
My school for example, decided to change the schedule of how school is going to be attended so I had to adapt.

## Productivity
I significantly modified and streamlined  my Life Management System(LMS). This has resulted in me doing more every week.
There are still things I have to figure out about myself when it comes to working on personal projects.
I have a pattern where I work in "bursts" and then I don't do anything for a while.
I'm going to try and see if I can work on things more consistently, but if I can't I'll have to find a way to use this to my advantage.
There are other systems that I have added that are not public yet because they're still being fleshed out.
A Knowledge Management System(KMS) and a Zettelkasten that I will use to post things that don't warrant a blog post.

## Relationships
I managed to call people I normally would never call and I've added some reminders to call people so I don't forget. 
I plan to continue this next month and do more. 
I've also scheduled group calls with friends, so I have people to talk to outside of family and work friends.

## Programming
I've started projects I call "boosts". 
I pilfered the idea from [rwxrob](https://github.com/rwxrob).
The general idea is they're supposed to get me or someone like me to a point where they know and have used certain techniques.
So in the case of python_boost, I've learned how to use decorators properly and I have a project where I'm going to use it so the general idea sticks in my head.
They will be made available on [my github](https://github.com/lawrencelogoh) so keep an eye out.

## Money
Outside of [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/larrylogoh) I'm talking to some people but nothing concrete yet so fingers crossed.

## Other Skills
I suspect I've made zero progress here. 
When it comes to creative writing, I would classify it as a "wicked domain", as described by David Epstein in Range.
I'm not sure if becoming good, is a matter of deliberate practice alone but I'm sure it helps.
I'll read some books about writing and see what comes of it.
I'll also analyze writing that I like and see what I can take from them.
In the case of the other creative outlet, I've made no progress there as well.
I'm tempted to start making electronic music instead of waiting to get a guitar.
If I don't get an electric guitar by June I'll start that instead.

## School
I didn't add this to my goals for this year because it wasn't but I want to try harder at school.
Yes, I've made a system for this too. I did have one already but it wasn't clearly defined.
I basically took notes and made flashcards that I studied a day to exams.
I managed to get A+s in subjects I liked but did abysmally even in difficult subjects I liked.


All in all, it's been a good month but I'll try to do better next month.
