This was a good month.
I'm happy with how it went overall.
Some things are still rough around the edges but they'll all get ironed
out in time.

## Health
In this aspect, all tasks have been done.
All that is left is for me to do things that I've decided on.
For most of the month, as part of my morning routine I workout.
It's not a difficult workout, but it's easy enough that I'm able to do
it every day.
I missed a few days because of what I'll call "unforeseen
circumstances".
On most days, I did them and I'm happy about that.
I've cut out soda for the most part too.
It doesn't help that I recently discovered Monster Energy.
And unfortunately, I love the taste. I thought Red Bull was good but
Monster is something else.
I try to have it once a week on my cheat day.
I regards to weight, I did gain weight around when I started working
out.
It has started to go down again so I'm happy.


## Productivity
I've started tracking my habits with org-habit. 
I'm trying to build habits of studying and programming everyday.
My consistency is not at a level at which I like but I'll keep trying.

## Relationships
*Scratches Head*

## Programming
The studying habit encompasses this. I program everyday and I try to
learn about programming everyday. This means I'm learning general things like
data structures and algorithms but I'm also learning how to use specific
technologies like ThreeJS right now. 

## Money
No tangible progress here yet.
I'm trying a few things and if they don't work, I'll try other things.
I believe I'll cross the $1000 threshold for sure but I'll need to put
in some extra work for that extra $1000.

## Other skills
I haven't learned much about design for some reason.
The main thing I learned about this month was music.
I think I got distracted along the way. 
I'll course-correct and we'll revisit this next time.


I'll try to do better next month.
