This is my worst month so far.
The general theme has been "reactionary".

## Productivity
My productivity level is satisfactory.
I'm not as disciplined as I want to be but I'm getting there.

My Life Management System(LMS) is at a place I'm happy with right now.
There might be slight tweaks in the future but I consider the project done.
Expect an article on that soon :).

## Relationships
This time I have negative feelings about this area.
I didn't make time for the people I care about.
And I haven't been straightforward with people.
A regression, to be sure, but all I can do is try to be better.

## Programming
Progress has been made here. 
I have dedicated time to learning and I'm sticking to it as best as I can.
The results will speak for themselves :).

## Money
There has been no progress on making extra money.
On the bright side, I've made progress on managing the money I do have.
Speaking of money, most people seem really weird about it.
Maybe "pocket watching" is the best way to describe it.
It's made me consider not talking about it publicly anymore.
On the other hand, maybe it's a good way to filter out certain people from my life.

## Other skills
I've downloaded Ardour and I'm playing around with it.
Don't expect an EDM album anytime soon though. 

I'm not sure how to gauge if my writing is improving or not.
Maybe you can tell?

Overall, not a bad month, but not a great one either.
I'll try to do better next month.
