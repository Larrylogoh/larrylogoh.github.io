Halfway there.

## Productivity
Considering where I was in January, I have positive feelings about this.
I still use org files but things are a little different.
I'm more confident with the system, and I'm doing more things.
I haven't necessarily been doing the right things, but again, progress has been made.
There's room for improvement.

## Relationships
This is another one where I have positive feelings.
I've called people I cared about and I made time for activities with them.
I wasn't as consistent as I wanted to be but again, progress.

## Programming
This is where things start to go downhill. 
I have improved, but not as much as I wanted to.
On top of that, most of my improvement weren't from deliberate learning, which I don't like.
I also have nothing to show for it outside of work.
Radical change will need to be made for me to be happy with this.

## Money
This is another one I'm happy about. I'm not making my goal of $2000/month. I'm not even making my goal of $1000 month.
I still want to make $2000/month. My current job is flexible enough that it's possible if I do more online gigs.
Even if I don't get to $2000/month, the fact that I've made progress makes me happy.
It's better than $0/month.

## Other skills
I've made zero progress in this area. I'm not sure how I feel about that. I think I can still make time for these things.
I don't think my writing has improved at all.
There's no excuse. I haven't tried to actively improve.
I haven't bought a guitar yet, so I'm considering diving into EDM production and seeing how I like it.

I'm happy with how the year has gone overall but improvements can be made.
