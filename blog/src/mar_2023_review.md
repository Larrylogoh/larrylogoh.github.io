This was a great month. 
I haven't built as many great habits as I wanted to but I'm trying and these things take time.

## Money
I landed  a job with a company called [Blue Torus](https://torus.blue). The pay is good, the hours are amazing and I get to work with cool people.
I'm still a ways from my goal of $2000 a month but this is stable income, which is a big improvement from only doing freelancing gigs. 
I am still freelancing though, the hours for the job are flexible enough that I can do that. 


## Productivity
One thing I've decided to add to my productivity system is my finances.
I've decided to take my finances a bit more seriously so I can be more responsible with my money. The tool is a bit of a problem right now though. I want to use something like Ledger in combination with ledger-mode because it deals with plaintext files, but I have to learn it a little bit before it can become useful. I was torn between that and using something like GNUCash so I'm trying it out first.
If it doesn't work I'll use GNUCash or maybe even just org tables.


## Programming
Unfortunately, I haven't made too much progress on this. I haven't been able to consistently work on the projects that I've created to up my skills. I did do some work on the [Homebase prototype](https://github.com/homebaseorg/homebase-prototype) and I've learned more about React and NextJS which my new job requires. It's not all bad but this will be one of my main focal points moving forward.

## The dark lining in the silver cloud
Maybe a week after I started my new job, I was pickpocketed. I didn't lose any money but I did lose my phone. I got a replacement the next day, it's a worse phone but it'll do for now.

Great month overall.

Unlike last month I would mind if every month went like this.
Can't be losing my phone every month.
