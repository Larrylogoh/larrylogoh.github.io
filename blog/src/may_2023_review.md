This was another rough month. To a lesser extent than last month, but still...

My main focus was work and writing exams this month.
It was less rough because the exams are spaced out differently and they don't take as much time as a class.

## Productivity
I've become more productive but I've noticed that most of the things I'm doing aren't directly related to my goals.
Things are getting done but not the most important things.
I didn't think I'd have this problem so it's something to think about.


I don't have anything else to say about other areas of my life.
Things have been the same since last month.
I don't think that's a good thing.

Yes, you didn't read the date wrong. 
I almost didn't want to write this but I had to.
I'll write the next one on time and we'll continue like nothing happened.
