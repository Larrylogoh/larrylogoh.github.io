This month was for resting. I didn't push myself as hard as I could on
most days. I felt a little guilty because of this, but I think it's good.
It was a well earned rest after going full throttle for quite a while. 


## Productivity
I wasn't as productive as I was last month but because my baseline
productivity has increased, I'm not too worried about this.

## Relationships
I spent time with the people I cared about when I could, so I'm good on this front.

## Programming
I've had time to think about this quite a bit and to decide my direction
going forward. I know it sounds confusing but you'll understand after
you read the next article. 

In terms of doing programming itself, I didn't program as much as last
month. 

## Money
Money was a little tight this month, but I was able to stay afloat. I'll
also be talking about it in the next article.

Oh I did create a whole system to manage my finances though. I call it
the Personal Finance System(PFS). I won't go into it right now because I
still consider it a work in progress but it's basically a system to manage
money based on sound advice but also catering to my specific
idiosyncrasies.

## Other skills
I didn't put as much effort into this like everything else, but I've
found a way to schedule them in my calendar as they are becoming a bit
much to manage. I'm sure I'll pick up others along the way but they will
be put on the back burner until I drop any of the current ones.

Decent month overall. I think I'm ready to start going hard again but I'll try not to get too close to the sun ðŸ™‚.
