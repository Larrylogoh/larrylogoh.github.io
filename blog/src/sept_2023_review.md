This month was rough.
I say "this month" but clearly some of it bled into October.
My main focus was school. Specifically, finishing my final year project.
I also took on some extra work, thinking I could handle it, and I did.
But I had to pull a few all-nighters to make sure everything got done.
That took a huge toll on me physically and mentally.

Hopefully this is the worst month of this year. 

Let's try again.
