**_TLDR_**

_It just werks_

I used FreeBSD as my main system for about a month and I love it.
The speed, the Linux compatibility, jails, it's beautiful.
The only problem I had with it is, I had a lot of small problems.
There would be these little problems, like not being to login to Twitch.[^1]
Or some programs like ncspot not working at all.
OpenBSD doesn't feel as snappy as FreeBSD and it doesn't have Linux compatibility.
But it works.
Everything works the way I expect it to.

So, I think I'll be sticking with this as my main system for a while.
