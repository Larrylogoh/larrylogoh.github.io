using</h1>
<p><a
href="https://github.com/lawrencelogoh/lawrencelogoh.github.io/blob/master/build">A
badly written bash script that depends on pup and pandoc</a>.</p>
<p>I don’t mind the pandoc dependency too much as I have it on all my
systems anyway. But the script is really messy and I’d rather have
something cleaner.</p>
<h1 id="why-not-just-use-x">Why not just use “x”?</h1>
<p>Most of the static site generators I’ve seen like Hugo and Jekyll
seem too complicated for me. I’m not saying I can’t use them, I just
felt some friction and thought it would be cool to build my own.</p>
<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>
<ul>
<li>Must have as little dependencies as possible.</li>
<li>Must work on UNIX/UNIX-like systems</li>
<li>Must generate and RSS file with all blog posts</li>
<li>Must arrange blog posts by date</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="language-choice">Language choice</h1>
<p>My initial instinct was to use python, since I already used bash but
I think I’ll go with bash again. I’ll try to limit the programs I use in
it to what you’ll find on a standard Linux/BSD install.</p></article>
