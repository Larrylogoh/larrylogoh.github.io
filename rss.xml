      <description><![CDATA[<p>
The plan this year is to get good.
I'm okay at a few things, but I need to get really good.
I will write a detailed list of actions I will need to do to make this year a success but I'm not sure if I'll release it publicly or not.
We'll see.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-health" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="health">Health</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
This is going to be one of my main priorities this year.
The goal here is to lose weight and get in shape.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A healthy mind resides in a healthy body 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
My mental health isn't a big priority this year.
I have a high baseline of happiness so we can leave that for another time. 
This doesn't mean I will be neglecting it but it won't be a high priority.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-productivity" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
My system is at a place that I'm really happy with. 
The focus now is to be to build habits that will help me be more productive. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-relationships" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
A lot of progress was made last year but there is still more to be made.
The goal is to be more proactive and not just leave things to chance.
Yes, this applies to romantic relationships as well. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-programming" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I've done a lot of learning when it comes to programming but very little doing.
I'm still going to be learning but I'll be writing a lot of <del>bad</del> software so that I can get better.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-money" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="money">Money</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
The goal is the same as last year $2000/month.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
The plan this year was to play to my strengths and work on my weaknesses. I ended up doing both very poorly.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-productivity" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
My Life Management System(LMS) is at the point where I can see myself using it for the rest of my life. It's very simple and doesn't really depend on any tools even though I only use it with emacs.
</p>

<p>
There are a few issues like, using it on mobile but I think I can find an app that works reasonably well or make one.
</p>

<p>
My productivity itself has been boosted. Not only because of the system but because I pushed myself and realised what I was capable of. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-relationships" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I made a lot of progress here. I called people I care about a few times. Made time to just hang out where just being around friends was the goal. I checked on people a few times as well.
</p>

<p>
In terms of romantic relationships, I tried. I generally don't try but I tried this time. I was unsuccessful but I learned a lot not just about what I like but about the kind of person I am. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-programming" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
So I programmed a lot this year. More than I did last year. But I didn't do exactly what I planned to do.
</p>

<p>
I planned to get better at Python and Go and try out Rust and Zig. I got a job where I mainly work with JavaScript so that became my main focus. I did learn Python and Go but not as much as I had planned to.
</p>

<p>
I didn't even touch Rust and Zig. I did do some mobile development but no OS development. 
</p>

<p>
I'm not happy with how this went, but I'll try again next year.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-money" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="money">Money</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I didn't get to my goal of $2000/month. I have however moved from making $0 to a respectable amount. 
</p>

<p>
I've also had to think about money a lot<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>. I've decided that I want a lot of it now and I'm going to try everything I can to get it without compromising my morals or ethics.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-other-skills" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="other-skills">Other skills</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I'm not sure if my writing has improved or not. What I do know is that I'm not yet good enough so I'm going to keep trying.
</p>

<p>
I haven't practised drawing enough but I am practising. 
</p>

<p>
I didn't buy an electric guitar but I have started learning how to use a DAW to make music. Music is the hardest thing I've had to learn so far but I will keep trying.

Overall, this was a good year.
I'm not happy with how some things went, but I'll learn from it and try to make next year better.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
Growing up, I've always had a unique relationship with money. While I didn't grow up "rich", money was never a thing I had to think about. Sometimes I got what I wanted, other times my parents told me it was outside of their budget and I understood(even if I was mad). 
</p>

<div id="outline-container-early-perspective-on-programming-and-money" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="early-perspective-on-programming-and-money">Early Perspective on Programming and Money</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I don't think I'm unique in feeling like this, but some part of me felt like trying to make money with programming was bad. It felt like programming with the express goal of making money was bad. In my mind, programming was this pure "thing" and using it solely to pursue money dirtied it. I even saw people who did that as dirty as well. 
</p>

<p>
Sure they could do what they wanted but I cringed whenever they would call themselves programmers or god forbid "software engineers" because they weren't "real programmers" <del>like me</del>. 
</p>

<p>
Keep in mind, this is me at around fourteen years old. Eleven years have passed since then and I've changed a lot. I've come to understand that wanting to make a lot of money isn't a bad thing. If programming helps someone achieve that, then more power to them. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-reflection-on-pieter-levels-article" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="reflection-on-pieter-levels-article">Reflection on Pieter Levels' Article</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
A few days ago I read an article by Pieter Levels titled <a href="https://levels.io/how-i-build-my-minimum-viable-products/">"How I build my minimum viable products"</a>. I read it because I've been thinking about ways to make money with programming and he seemed to be good at doing just that. I think it's a helpful article and if you want to do a similar thing to what he's doing, go read it. 
</p>

<p>
While reading the article, two sentences caught my attention.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Programming is not my passion. Making stuff is my passion.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I felt a little uncomfortable reading that. The making stuff part I can understand because, of course, I want to make stuff, but I think I still agreed with fourteen-year-old me on some level. So I decided to sit down and think about why it made me feel uncomfortable beyond it dirtying programming and I came up with an answer that felt right.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Should I sell out?
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-changing-perspective" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="changing-perspective">Changing Perspective</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
It felt like it was an either or choice. One thing that helped me changed my mind was this stream by George Hotz titled [[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2bXEUSAiTI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2bXEUSAiTI</a>]["what is programming? (noob lessons!)]"]. 
</p>

<p>
In the stream he makes a distinction between a thing he calls "High Brow Software Engineering" and another he calls "Translating business requirements into code". We call both of them programming but they're different things. I think the latter is self explanatory but the former is best explained by George <a href="https://youtu.be/N2bXEUSAiTI?si=ghH_2nW3MVSWIfJk&amp;t=1260">here</a>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-conclusion" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
The conclusion I came to was that I can do both. One can be a thing I do for work and the other can be something I do for fun. The thing that I will keep in mind is that while I am "selling out" I'm still going to be selective in the things that I build. I'm not going to build yet another AI tool that uses OpenAI's APIs in a really basic way for example. 
</p>

<p>
While the things I'm passionate about may not bring money in the short term, I think I should still do them because I enjoy them. On the other hand, I need money so I will "sell out" at least for a time and create products that people want to use. The hope will be that in the future I can spend more time on the programming I enjoy and less time on the one I don't enjoy. 
</p>

<p>
From now on you'll be seeing a lot of projects that I will be working on. Some of them will be products designed to make me money and some will be things I think are cool. While I'm doing this, I will be on the lookout for something that is both fun and profitable. 
</p>

<p>
Hopefully I find it.

      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
The basic idea behind this year is to play to my strengths and work on my weaknesses. Min-maxing essentially. 
A lot of these things are not checklist items that I can just list and tick off.
They require step-by-step plans which I will make and follow.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-productivity" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I already have a system that I use to manage my life. It's just a folder of org files that I like to call my LMS(Life Management System).
I plan to rethink and clearly define this system and some of the other systems that I use in conjunction with it.
I think doing that will boost my productivity.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-relationships" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
When it comes to relationships, I'm very passive.
I generally don't call or text people until they call me and I don't check on people I care about.
When I talk to people about how they do it, they say it just comes naturally to them.
For whatever reason, that doesn't happen for me. But I want to do it, so I'm going to be more active and intentional about my relationships.
This will involve not only calling and checking on people more, but also planning and scheduling activities to spend more time with the people I care about.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-programming" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I know some programming languages but I don't think I know any of them well enough.
So the plan is to become good at two of them at least. 
Python and Go seem like the obvious choices so I'll go with them for now.
While I do that, I also plan to at least check out Rust and Zig and see how I like them.
When it comes to programming domains, I want to become a well-rounded backend developer and improve my frontend skills.
Beyond that, I will be trying out other domains like mobile development and OS development(for fun).
What this will generally look like is, building a lot of projects that are not necessarily useful to the general public. But if I can do that, I will.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-money" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="money">Money</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I've lived a very comfortable life.
Because of that, I haven't had to think about money until now.
I want to do a lot of cool stuff but money seems to be the thing that I lack to do them.
So this year, I'm going to focus on making money.
My humble goal, for now, is at least an average income of $2000/month by the end of the year.
I know I can make more than that, but I live in Ghana, and most employers don't pay that much.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-other-skills" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="other-skills">Other skills</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
As you can already tell, my writing is shit. 
I want to write a book next year about a concept I'm chewing on, so it has to be improved.
Another big one is some type of artistic outlet that is not writing. The ones I'm most attracted to right now are drawing and the electric guitar. 
</p>

<p>
This is a non-exhaustive list but these are the non-negotiables. They come first before everything else.
</p>

<p>
Happy New Year.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>
Overall, this was a good year.
Unfortunately, I wasn't as productive as I had hoped to be.
But, I learned a lot about myself and I made progress.
</p>

<p>
I started learning Go and C, started some new projects, and even lost some weight.
I also made some new friends along the way.
</p>

<p>
While I'm happy with how the year went in general, I can't help but feel like I could have done more.
</p>

<p>
One of the big things I tried to learn was to not take things too seriously.
It would feel like the world was ending if I forgot about some homework, for example.
I feel like I took it a bit too far, but I think I'm ready to try a more <b>balanced</b> approach.
</p>

<p>
I have a good feeling about next year.

      <title>Building a static site generator</title>

      <author>Lawrence Logoh</author>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">/blog/building-a-static-site-generator.html</guid>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>
What I was using is <a href="https://github.com/lawrencelogoh/lawrencelogoh.github.io/blob/921d8d1012f73c6298b7d5412404b0f7b2a33ed/build">a badly written bash script that depends on pup and pandoc</a>.
I don't mind the pandoc dependency too much as I have it on all my systems anyway. 
But the script is messy and I'd rather have something cleaner.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-why-not-just-use-x" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="why-not-just-use-x">"Why not just use x?"</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Most of the static site generators I've seen like Hugo and Jekyll seem too complicated for me.
I'm not saying I can't use them, I just felt some friction and thought it would be cool to build my own.
</p>

<p>
My requirements for the current script were:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Must have as few dependencies as possible.</li>
<li>Must work on UNIX/UNIX-like systems</li>
<li>Must generate an RSS file with all blog posts</li>
<li>Must arrange blog posts by date</li>
</ul>

<p>
I didn't put too much thought into how the old script worked.
I started by writing a function that compiles the markdown files of my blog posts.
Everything else came after that.
Whenever I hit a roadblock, I looked for a program that could help me.
In the end, I had a hacky script that worked but I wasn't proud of it.
I also started to run into problems when I wanted to add new functionality or change something.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/lawrencelogoh/lawrencelogoh.github.io/blob/9c27fe701fb522f936147f5ad5fbd01a02f7ad13/build">The current script</a> is not as bad.
The way that it works is, it assumes every directory(including the root directory) has an <code>src</code> subdirectory.
It compiles every markdown file in the <code>src</code> subdirectories to HTML files that live in the directory itself.
To get away with not creating an <code>index.html</code> I create an <code>index.md</code> instead and that gets compiled like every other markdown file.
That's the core of how it works.
If you want the details, read the script.
</p>


<p>
I'm happy with how it works right now but there's a minor annoyance I have with it.
The blog posts are arranged according to their dates by putting the date
in the file name.
</p>

<p>
<i>Yuck</i>.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
I tried using an associative array to do it at first, but I found it difficult to sort the dates with the sort program.
I'll figure it out eventually.
</p>


<p>
If you have any suggestions email me or send a pull request :).
