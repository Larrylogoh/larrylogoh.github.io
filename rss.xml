		<description><![CDATA[    <article><p>What I was using is <ahref="https://github.com/lawrencelogoh/lawrencelogoh.github.io/blob/921d8d1012f73c6298b7d5412404b0f7b2a33ed/build">abadly written bash script that depends on pup and pandoc</a>. I don’tmind the pandoc dependency too much as I have it on all my systemsanyway. But the script is messy and I’d rather have somethingcleaner.</p><p>“Why not just use x?”</p><p>Most of the static site generators I’ve seen like Hugo and Jekyllseem too complicated for me. I’m not saying I can’t use them, I justfelt some friction and thought it would be cool to build my own.</p><p>My requirements for the current script were:</p><ul><li>Must have as few dependencies as possible.</li><li>Must work on UNIX/UNIX-like systems</li><li>Must generate an RSS file with all blog posts</li><li>Must arrange blog posts by date</li></ul><p>I didn’t put too much thought into how the old script worked. Istarted by writing a function that compiles the markdown files of myblog posts. Everything else came after that. Whenever I hit a roadblock,I looked for a program that could help me. In the end, I had a hackyscript that worked but I wasn’t proud of it. I also started to run intoproblems when I wanted to add new functionality or change something.</p><p><ahref="https://github.com/lawrencelogoh/lawrencelogoh.github.io/blob/9c27fe701fb522f936147f5ad5fbd01a02f7ad13/build">Thecurrent script</a> is not as bad. The way that it works is, it assumesevery directory(including the root directory) has an <code>src</code>subdirectory. It compiles every markdown file in the <code>src</code>subdirectories to HTML files that live in the directory itself. To getaway with not creating an <code>index.html</code> I create an<code>index.md</code> instead and that gets compiled like every othermarkdown file.</p><p>That’s the core of how it works. If you want the details, read thescript.</p><p>I’m happy with how it works right now but there’s a minor annoyance Ihave with it. The blog posts are arranged according to their dates byputting the date in the file name.</p><p><em>Yuck</em>.</p><p>I tried using an associative array to do it at first, but I found itdifficult to sort the dates with the sort program. I’ll figure it outeventually</p><p>If you have any suggestions email me or send a pull request:).</p></article>]]></description>
