		<description><![CDATA[    <article><p>Overall, this was a good year. Unfortunately, I wasn’t as productive as I had hoped to be. But, I learned a lot about myself and I made progress. I started learning Go and C, started some new projects, and even lost some weight. I also made some new friends along the way.</p> <p>While I’m happy with how the year went in general, I can’t help but feel like I could have done more. One of the big things I tried to learn was to not take things too seriously. It would feel like the world was ending if I forgot about some homework, for example. I feel like I took it a bit too far, but I think I’m ready to try a more <em>balanced</em> approach.</p> <p>I have a good feeling about next year.</p></article> ]]></description>

		<title>Plans for 2023</title>

		<description><![CDATA[    <article><p>The basic idea behind this year is to play to my strengths and work on my weaknesses. Min-maxing essentially. A lot of these things are not checklist items that I can just list and tick off. They require step-by-step plans which I will make and follow.</p> <h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2> <p>I already have a system that I use to manage my life. It’s just a folder of org files that I like to call my LMS(Life Management System). I plan to rethink and clearly define this system and some of the other systems that I use in conjunction with it. I think doing that will boost my productivity.</p> <h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2> <p>When it comes to relationships, I’m very passive. I generally don’t call or text people until they call me and I don’t check on people I care about. When I talk to people about how they do it, they say it just comes naturally to them. For whatever reason, that doesn’t happen for me. But I want to do it, so I’m going to be more active and intentional about my relationships. This will involve not only calling and checking on people more, but also planning and scheduling activities to spend more time with the people I care about.</p> <h2 id="programming">Programming</h2> <p>I know some programming languages but I don’t think I know any of them well enough. So the plan is to become good at two of them at least. Python and Go seem like the obvious choices so I’ll go with them for now. While I do that, I also plan to at least check out Rust and Zig and see how I like them. When it comes to programming domains, I want to become a well-rounded backend developer and improve my frontend skills. Beyond that, I will be trying out other domains like mobile development and OS development(for fun). What this will generally look like is, building a lot of projects that are not necessarily useful to the general public. But if I can do that, I will.</p> <h2 id="money">Money</h2> <p>I’ve lived a very comfortable life. Because of that, I haven’t had to think about money until now. I want to do a lot of cool stuff but money seems to be the thing that I lack to do them. So this year, I’m going to focus on making money. My humble goal, for now, is at least an average income of $2000/month by the end of the year. I know I can make more than that, but I live in Ghana, and most employers don’t pay that much.</p> <h2 id="other-skills">Other skills</h2> <p>As you can already tell, my writing is shit. I want to write a book next year about a concept I’m chewing on, so it has to be improved. Another big one is some type of artistic outlet that is not writing. The ones I’m most attracted to right now are drawing and the electric guitar.</p> <p>This is a non-exhaustive list but these are the non-negotiables. They come first before everything else.</p> <p>Happy New Year.</p></article> ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[    <article><p>Better late than never…right?</p> <p>This month was rough. I thought it’d be a piece of cake to handle school, work and personal projects. It wasn’t.</p> <h2 id="money">Money</h2> <p>It’s nice having a regular stream of income. It’s liberating in a way. Things I want to try out or buy don’t seem out of reach. I’ve been winging it when it comes to management though, so I’ll be taking it more seriously going forward.</p> <h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2> <p>I had some health issues that lasted for about a week. This made it hard to get back into a rhythm but I figured it out eventually. I think I was sufficiently productive, but this is only true when it comes to work and school. My personal projects didn’t get any love. I think I’ve found my feet at work now so it shouldn’t be a problem going forward. My school workload is going to reduce next semester too so that should help.</p> <h2 id="programming">Programming</h2> <p>I haven’t made much progress on this outside of work. So my JavaScript skills have gone up, but that’s a consequence of working with it, not intentionally trying to improve. I intend to change that next month. I want to be more intentional about it.</p> <hr /> <p>Decent month.</p> <p>Not the best but I can only look forward and try harder. Hopefully next month will be better.</p></article> ]]></description>

		<title>Building a static site generator</title>
		<link>https://lawrencelogoh.com/blog/building_ssg.html</link>

		<description><![CDATA[    <article><p>What I was using is <a href="https://github.com/lawrencelogoh/lawrencelogoh.github.io/blob/921d8d1012f73c6298b7d5412404b0f7b2a33ed/build">a badly written bash script that depends on pup and pandoc</a>. I don’t mind the pandoc dependency too much as I have it on all my systems anyway. But the script is messy and I’d rather have something cleaner.</p> <p>“Why not just use x?”</p> <p>Most of the static site generators I’ve seen like Hugo and Jekyll seem too complicated for me. I’m not saying I can’t use them, I just felt some friction and thought it would be cool to build my own.</p> <p>My requirements for the current script were:</p> <ul> <li>Must have as few dependencies as possible.</li> <li>Must work on UNIX/UNIX-like systems</li> <li>Must generate an RSS file with all blog posts</li> <li>Must arrange blog posts by date</li> </ul> <p>I didn’t put too much thought into how the old script worked. I started by writing a function that compiles the markdown files of my blog posts. Everything else came after that. Whenever I hit a roadblock, I looked for a program that could help me. In the end, I had a hacky script that worked but I wasn’t proud of it. I also started to run into problems when I wanted to add new functionality or change something.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/lawrencelogoh/lawrencelogoh.github.io/blob/9c27fe701fb522f936147f5ad5fbd01a02f7ad13/build">The current script</a> is not as bad. The way that it works is, it assumes every directory(including the root directory) has an <code>src</code> subdirectory. It compiles every markdown file in the <code>src</code> subdirectories to HTML files that live in the directory itself. To get away with not creating an <code>index.html</code> I create an <code>index.md</code> instead and that gets compiled like every other markdown file.</p> <p>That’s the core of how it works. If you want the details, read the script.</p> <p>I’m happy with how it works right now but there’s a minor annoyance I have with it. The blog posts are arranged according to their dates by putting the date in the file name.</p> <p><em>Yuck</em>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p> <p>I tried using an associative array to do it at first, but I found it difficult to sort the dates with the sort program. I’ll figure it out eventually.</p> <p>If you have any suggestions email me or send a pull request :).</p> <section id="footnotes" class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-document" role="doc-endnotes"> <hr /> <ol> <li id="fn1"><p>I have since implemented what I call “ghetto sorting”. It’s not pretty but it works<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li> </ol> </section></article> ]]></description>

		<title>February 2023 Review</title>

		<description><![CDATA[    <article><p>I’ve made more progress than I did last month. Some areas are essentially “done” but what’s left is to build habits around them. I won’t talk about some areas but that’s because there’s either no progress or no notable progress.</p> <h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2> <p>I’m happy with the current system I have. It does exactly what I want it to. I’m not fully used to all parts of it but that’ll come with time. One new thing I want to try is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghVdzAeX0bg">batching</a>. This is because when I work on things for extended periods of time(4+ hours) I feel more productive. The <a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/research/multitasking">task switching costs</a> for my normal days seem to be a lot of wasted time.</p> <p>In other news, my <a href="https://github.com/lawrencelogoh/kms">kms</a> is out. It’s empty right now, but I will be adding to it over time.</p> <h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2> <p>The framework I use for this is satisfactory. It still feels uncomfortable and I don’t always follow through. My intuition is that this is because it’s a foreign thing for me, so I’ll try to power through and hope it gets easier with time. If it doesn’t I’ll have to make some modifications to the system.</p> <h2 id="programming">Programming</h2> <p>Programming is hard. I’ve realized that I know quite a few programming languages but I don’t know them well enough to use them in a real project. Case in point my project Homebase. I decided to use Go for this project but there was too much resistance when I was building it. It felt like I was fighting against the language. What I’ve decided to do is to build a <a href="https://github.com/homebaseorg/homebase-prototype">prototype</a> in Python first and then build the real project in Go. I am still doing my boosts of course, when I’m done doing them I will release them on Github.</p> <h2 id="school">School</h2> <p>The current system is good enough. I have taken a bit of a different approach of how I use it though. Normally, what I would do is I would try and fit exactly what the lecturer says or their slides into the flashcards. It worked but there was too much fluff so now what I do is, I “prune” my notes before making flashcards.</p> <h2 id="something-interesting-im-thinking-about">Something Interesting I’m Thinking About</h2> <p>I forget how I came across the concept of an <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2008/readings/engler95exokernel.pdf">exokernel</a> but it’s been stuck in my head ever since. In simple terms, an exokernel is a minimalist operating system architecture that gives applications direct access to hardware resources for optimized performance and flexibility. From that, I’m sure a plethora of reasons come to mind about why this would be a bad idea. I just think it would be a fun thing to build.</p> <p>Overall, this month was better than last month.</p> <p>I wouldn’t mind if every month was like this</p></article> ]]></description>

		<title>January 2023 Review</title>
		<link>https://lawrencelogoh.com/blog/jan_2023_review.html</link>

		<description><![CDATA[    <article><p>I haven’t made much headway with <a href="https://lawrencelogoh.com/blog/2023_plans.html">my goals for this year</a>. Most of the month was spent figuring out how to structure things. I’ve figured out some things about myself and some external factors have also changed. My school for example, decided to change the schedule of how school is going to be attended so I had to adapt.</p> <h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2> <p>I significantly modified and streamlined my Life Management System(LMS). This has resulted in me doing more every week. There are still things I have to figure out about myself when it comes to working on personal projects. I have a pattern where I work in “bursts” and then I don’t do anything for a while. I’m going to try and see if I can work on things more consistently, but if I can’t I’ll have to find a way to use this to my advantage. There are other systems that I have added that are not public yet because they’re still being fleshed out. A Knowledge Management System(KMS) and a Zettelkasten that I will use to post things that don’t warrant a blog post.</p> <h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2> <p>I managed to call people I normally would never call and I’ve added some reminders to call people so I don’t forget. I plan to continue this next month and do more. I’ve also scheduled group calls with friends, so I have people to talk to outside of family and work friends.</p> <h2 id="programming">Programming</h2> <p>I’ve started projects I call “boosts”. I pilfered the idea from <a href="https://github.com/rwxrob">rwxrob</a>. The general idea is they’re supposed to get me or someone like me to a point where they know and have used certain techniques. So in the case of python_boost, I’ve learned how to use decorators properly and I have a project where I’m going to use it so the general idea sticks in my head. They will be made available on <a href="https://github.com/lawrencelogoh">my github</a> so keep an eye out.</p> <h2 id="money">Money</h2> <p>Outside of <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/larrylogoh">Fiverr</a> I’m talking to some people but nothing concrete yet so fingers crossed.</p> <h2 id="other-skills">Other Skills</h2> <p>I suspect I’ve made zero progress here. When it comes to creative writing, I would classify it as a “wicked domain”, as described by David Epstein in Range. I’m not sure if becoming good, is a matter of deliberate practice alone but I’m sure it helps. I’ll read some books about writing and see what comes of it. I’ll also analyze writing that I like and see what I can take from them. In the case of the other creative outlet, I’ve made no progress there as well. I’m tempted to start making electronic music instead of waiting to get a guitar. If I don’t get an electric guitar by June I’ll start that instead.</p> <h2 id="school">School</h2> <p>I didn’t add this to my goals for this year because it wasn’t but I want to try harder at school. Yes, I’ve made a system for this too. I did have one already but it wasn’t clearly defined. I basically took notes and made flashcards that I studied a day to exams. I managed to get A+s in subjects I liked but did abysmally even in difficult subjects I liked.</p> <p>All in all, it’s been a good month but I’ll try to do better next month.</p></article> ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[    <article><p>This is my worst month so far. The general theme has been “reactionary”.</p> <h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2> <p>My productivity level is satisfactory. I’m not as disciplined as I want to be but I’m getting there.</p> <p>My Life Management System(LMS) is at a place I’m happy with right now. There might be slight tweaks in the future but I consider the project done. Expect an article on that soon :).</p> <h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2> <p>This time I have negative feelings about this area. I didn’t make time for the people I care about. And I haven’t been straightforward with people.</p> <p>A regression, to be sure, but all I can do is try to be better.</p> <h2 id="programming">Programming</h2> <p>Progress has been made here. I have dedicated time to learning and I’m sticking to it as best as I can. The results will speak for themselves :).</p> <h2 id="money">Money</h2> <p>There has been no progress on making extra money. On the bright side, I’ve made progress on managing the money I do have. Speaking of money, most people seem really weird about it. Maybe “pocket watching” is the best way to describe it. It’s made me consider not talking about it publicly anymore.</p> <p>On the other hand, maybe it’s a good way to filter out certain people from my life.</p> <h2 id="other-skills">Other skills</h2> <p>I’ve downloaded Ardour and I’m playing around with it. Don’t expect an EDM album anytime soon though.</p> <p>I’m not sure how to gauge if my writing is improving or not. Maybe you can tell?</p> <hr /> <p>Overall, not a bad month, but not a great one either. I’ll try to do better next month.</p></article> ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[    <article><p>Halfway there.</p> <h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2> <p>Considering where I was in January, I have positive feelings about this. I still use org files but things are a little different. I’m more confident with the system, and I’m doing more things. I haven’t necessarily been doing the right things, but again, progress has been made. There’s room for improvement.</p> <h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2> <p>This is another one where I have positive feelings. I’ve called people I cared about and I made time for activities with them. I wasn’t as consistent as I wanted to be but again, progress.</p> <h2 id="programming">Programming</h2> <p>This is where things start to go downhill. I have improved, but not as much as I wanted to. On top of that, most of my improvement weren’t from deliberate learning, which I don’t like. I also have nothing to show for it outside of work. Radical change will need to be made for me to be happy with this.</p> <h2 id="money">Money</h2> <p>This is another one I’m happy about. I’m not making my goal of $2000/month. I’m not even making my goal of $1000 month. I still want to make $2000/month. My current job is flexible enough that it’s possible if I do more online gigs. Even if I don’t get to $2000/month, the fact that I’ve made progress makes me happy. It’s better than $0/month.</p> <h2 id="other-skills">Other skills</h2> <p>I’ve made zero progress in this area. I’m not sure how I feel about that. I think I can still make time for these things. I don’t think my writing has improved at all. There’s no excuse. I haven’t tried to actively improve. I haven’t bought a guitar yet, so I’m considering diving into EDM production and seeing how I like it.</p> <hr /> <p>I’m happy with how the year has gone overall but improvements can be made.</p></article> ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[    <article><p>This was a great month. I haven’t built as many great habits as I wanted to but I’m trying and these things take time.</p> <h2 id="money">Money</h2> <p>I landed a job with a company called <a href="https://torus.blue">Blue Torus</a>. The pay is good, the hours are amazing and I get to work with cool people. I’m still a ways from my goal of $2000 a month but this is stable income, which is a big improvement from only doing freelancing gigs. I am still freelancing though, the hours for the job are flexible enough that I can do that.</p> <h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2> <p>One thing I’ve decided to add to my productivity system is my finances. I’ve decided to take my finances a bit more seriously so I can be more responsible with my money. The tool is a bit of a problem right now though. I want to use something like Ledger in combination with ledger-mode because it deals with plaintext files, but I have to learn it a little bit before it can become useful. I was torn between that and using something like GNUCash so I’m trying it out first. If it doesn’t work I’ll use GNUCash or maybe even just org tables.</p> <h2 id="programming">Programming</h2> <p>Unfortunately, I haven’t made too much progress on this. I haven’t been able to consistently work on the projects that I’ve created to up my skills. I did do some work on the <a href="https://github.com/homebaseorg/homebase-prototype">Homebase prototype</a> and I’ve learned more about React and NextJS which my new job requires. It’s not all bad but this will be one of my main focal points moving forward.</p> <h2 id="the-dark-lining-in-the-silver-cloud">The dark lining in the silver cloud</h2> <p>Maybe a week after I started my new job, I was pickpocketed. I didn’t lose any money but I did lose my phone. I got a replacement the next day, it’s a worse phone but it’ll do for now.</p> <hr /> <p>Great month overall.</p> <p>Unlike last month I would mind if every month went like this. Can’t be losing my phone every month.</p></article> ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[    <article><p>This was another rough month. To a lesser extent than last month, but still…</p> <p>My main focus was work and writing exams this month. It was less rough because the exams are spaced out differently and they don’t take as much time as a class.</p> <h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2> <p>I’ve become more productive but I’ve noticed that most of the things I’m doing aren’t directly related to my goals. Things are getting done but not the most important things. I didn’t think I’d have this problem so it’s something to think about.</p> <p>I don’t have anything else to say about other areas of my life. Things have been the same since last month. I don’t think that’s a good thing.</p> <hr /> <p>Yes, you didn’t read the date wrong. I almost didn’t want to write this but I had to. I’ll write the next one on time and we’ll continue like nothing happened.</p></article> ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[    <article><p>All things considered, this was a good month. It was tough balancing, school, work and freelance gigs but I managed to do it. Now school is off the plate so we can redirect energy elsewhere.</p> <h2 id="productivity">Productivity</h2> <p>This is the most productive I’ve ever been. However, it was mostly fueled by coffee, red bull and dread. So in other words, not sustainable. A strange thing that has happened as a result of this is that I feel like I’ve “unlocked” something. I’ll have to think about it a bit more but my it feels like my baseline productivity has improved as a result.</p> <h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2> <p>I was busy but not busy enough to not make time. I could’ve done better. I’ll try to do better next month.</p> <h2 id="programming">Programming</h2> <p>I’ve done a lot of programming this month. I’m not sure if that translates to me being better but it’s something.</p> <h2 id="money">Money</h2> <p>I made some extra money this month. It came with added stress but it was worth it. Now that I’m done with school I can put in more effort into getting money.</p> <h2 id="other-skills">Other skills</h2> <p>I’m still learning how to make music with Ardour. It might be the hardest thing I’ve had to learn. It just feels foreign to me and there’s so much to take in.</p> <p>I’m also learning how to draw and web design. I’m learning drawing for fun but I’m learning web design to be able to build web apps from end to end instead of just being able to code a design.</p> <hr /> <p>Overall, good month. I’m still reeling from the roller coaster that was last month but I think I’ll be 100% soon and things will be back to normal.</p></article> ]]></description>
